# Gender Recognition
This project takes a list of sound .wav files as an input and apply Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT) to extract the sound frequency. 
Then, from the frequency, it determines whether it is a man or a woman.

To run the project
Specify the folder containing the wav files in the code.
Then run by "python Gender_Recognition.py" in the command line
